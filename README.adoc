= Kiali.io

toc::[]

This repository contains the source code for the https://pre-v1-41.kiali.io[http://kiali.io] website.

The website is written using http://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoc], generated using https://gohugo.io[Hugo], hosted on Github and deployed using netlify.


== Requirements ==
To run the website locally, you will need:

* https://docker.io[Docker] or https://podman.io[Podman]
* https://www.gnu.org/software/make/[GNU Make]

Generally `podman` is easier to setup, but less used due to being newer.


== Configuring and Running ==
Hugo has a command to run a small, self-contained web server locally, so you can test the website without having to upload/deploy it anywhere. The server supports live-reload, so changes to the content will reflect into the browser as they happen.

To run the server, you need to run the following on a terminal:

[source,shell]
----
make serve
----

[NOTE]
====
If you are using podman, you need to set `CONTAINER_RUNTIME` when starting the server, as such:
====

[source,shell]
----
CONTAINER_RUNTIME=podman make serve
----

If everything is working as expected, you should see something like this:

[source,]

The server should be available on http://localhost:1313[http://localhost:1313]. Some files might not be supported for live reload. If, for some reason, you are not seeing your changes appearing you may need to restart the server.

== Production Deployment ==
