$0 [option...]

Releases the new documentation by creating a new version branch based on the current branch, and
making the current branch then based on the staging branch.

Valid options:
  -cb|--current-branch
      The name of the branch containing the current documentation. This branch will be the basis for
      the versioned documentation (see --current-version).
      Default: "${DEFAULT_CURRENT_BRANCH}"
  -cv|--current-version
      A new version branch will be created with the name of this version string.
      Note that it is expected that this be in the form of "vX.Y.Z" but only the "vX.Y" portion
      will be used by this script. However, if the "Z" number is anything other than "0" this script will abort.
      In other words, this script will not release patch-level documentation.
      This new version branch will be a copy of the "current" branch.
      Default: <undefined>
  -rn|--remote-name
      The name of the git remote where the branches are located. This is typically "origin".
      Default: <undefined>
  -sb|--staging-branch
      The name of the branch containing the content that will become the current version of the documentation.
      Default: "${DEFAULT_STAGING_BRANCH}"
