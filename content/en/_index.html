Kiali is a management console for Istio service mesh.

It provides robust observability for your running mesh, letting you quickly
identify issues and then troubleshoot those issues. Kiali offers in-depth
traffic topology, health grades, powerful dashboards, and lets you drill into
component detail.

Kiali offers correlated views of metrics, logs and tracing, as well as strong
validations to pinpoint configuration issues. Kiali provides several wizards to
help you add services to the mesh, define traffic routing, gateways, policies
and more.

Kiali includes Grafana and Jaeger integrations.
