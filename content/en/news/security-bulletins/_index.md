Kiali releases every three weeks and so generally resolves CVEs in new releases only.  Golang vulnerabilities are typically resolved in a timely way, as the Go version for release builds increments fairly often. Occasionally, critical CVEs may be resolved in patch releases for supported versions.  Additionally, not every CVE reported against a Kiali dependency is actually a vulnerability.  For reported CVEs that are proven not to affect Kiali, see the table below:

For Kiali-specific vulnerabilities there will be releases made as needed.  At release time a security bulletin will be release as well. For prior bulletins see below:
