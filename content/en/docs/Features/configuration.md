Kiali is more than observability, it also helps you to configure, update and validate your Istio service mesh.

The Istio configuration view provides advanced filtering and navigation for Istio configuration objects, such as Virtual Services and Gateways.
Kiali provides inline config editing and powerful semantic validation for Istio resources.

## Validations

Kiali performs a set of validations on your Istio Objects, such as Destination Rules, Service Entries, and Virtual Services. Kiali's validations go above and beyond what Istio offers.  Where Istio offers mainly static checks for well-formed definitions, Kiali performs semantic validations to ensure that the definitions make sense, across objects, and in some cases even across namespaces.  Kiali validations are based on the runtime status of your service mesh.

Check the complete [list of validations]({{< relref "validations" >}}) for further information.

## Wizards

Kiali Wizards provide a way to apply an Istio service mesh pattern, letting Kiali generate the Istio Configuration.
Wizards are launched from Kiali's Action menus, located across the UI on relevant pages.  Wizards can create and update
Istio Config for Routing, Gateways, Security scenarios and more.
