OpenShift Service Mesh Console (OSSMC) is a Kiali integration for OpenShift Console based on OpenShift [dynamic plugins](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/web_console/dynamic-plugin/dynamic-plugin-overview.html) technology. 
It integrates part of the Kiali UI functionality into the OpenShift Console, providing visibility of the Service Mesh.
