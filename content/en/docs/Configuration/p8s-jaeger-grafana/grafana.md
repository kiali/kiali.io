## Grafana configuration

Istio provides [preconfigured Grafana
dashboards](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/integrations/grafana/) for the
most relevant metrics of the mesh. Although Kiali offers similar views in its
metrics dashboards, it is not in Kiali's goals to provide the advanced querying
options, nor the highly customizable settings, that are available in Grafana.
Thus, it is recommended that you use Grafana if you need those advanced
options.

Kiali can provide a direct link from its metric dashboards to the equivalent or
most similar Grafana dashboard, which is convenient if you need the powerful
Grafana options. For these links to appear in Kiali you need to manually
configure what is the Grafana URL, like in the following example:

```yaml
spec:
  external_services:
    grafana:
      enabled: true
      # Grafana service name is "grafana" and is in the "telemetry" namespace.
      in_cluster_url: 'http://grafana.telemetry:3000/'
      # Public facing URL of Grafana
      url: 'http://my-ingress-host/grafana'
```
