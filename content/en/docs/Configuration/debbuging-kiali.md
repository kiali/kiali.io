Kiali provides the ability to emit debugging traces to the [distributed tracing](/docs/configuration/p8s-jaeger-grafana/tracing) platform, Jaeger or Grafana Tempo.

In the next release, the feature of Kiali emitting tracing data into Jaeger **will be deprecated**.
{{% /alert %}}

The traces can be sent in HTTP, HTTPS or gRPC protocol. This is specific for the collector type _otel_ - Jaeger traces are sent by http. It is also possible to use TLS. When _tls_enabled_ is set to true, one of the options _skip_verify_ or _ca_name_ should be specified. 

The traces can be sent in OTel or in Jaeger format. This is changed in the _collector_type_ setting. 

```yaml
server:
  observability:
    tracing:
      collector_type: "otel"
      collector_url: "localhost:4317"
      enabled: false
      otel:
        protocol: "grpc"
        tls_enabled: true
        skip_verify: false
        ca_name: "/tls.crt"
```

The traces emitted by Kiali can be searched using the service name _Kiali_.
