title: "No Istiod Access"
description: "Kiali behavior with no access to Istiod (the `/debug` endpoints are not available)"
---

## Introduction

Kiali makes use of the Istiod `/debug` endpoints for introspection into the control plane.   If this API is unavailable Kiali continues to perform, but the feature set will be degraded.  The Istio API can be unavailable for various reasons:

* The Istio API has been explicitly disabled in the Istio configuration.
* The [deployment model](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/deployment/deployment-models/#multiple-clusters) prevents access to the Istio API (firewalls, other networking concerns or limitations).
* The API is configured but for some, potentially unexpected, reason can not be reached by Kiali.

## Configuration

Kiali needs to be set up when the Istio registry is not accesible. This is done with a configuration item, istio_api_enabled.  
By default, istio_api_enabled is true. 

```yaml
# ...
spec:
external_services:
  istio:
    istio_api_enabled: false
# ...
```

## How does it affect Kiali

When Istio registry is not available, there are some expected changes: 

* The control plane metrics won't be available.
* The proxy status won't be available in the workloads details view.
* The namespace list will be obtained directly from the Kubernetes API, because it won't be possible to use the Istio cache. This could affect slightly the performance.
* The [Istio validations](#a-nameistio_validationsa-istio-validations) and the Kiali validations won't be available. There are, though, some cases where they will be still available.
* The [Istio Registry Services](#a-nameistio_registrya-istio-registry-services) that are not present in the Kubernetes list won't be available.
* The [Istio Configurations](#a-nameistio_configurationsa-istio-configurations) will be available. This is because the list of Istio configurations is obtained using the Kubernetes API.

### <a name="istio_validations"></a> Istio Validations

The Istio validations won't be available as this logic is provided by the Istio API. 
But, if the Istio Config was created when the validatingwebhookconfiguration web hook was enabled, the validation messages will be available and the Istio validations can be found:

<img src="/images/documentation/configuration/istio_validations.png" />

The Kiali validations won't be available, as they are degraded, so they have been disabled too. 

### <a name="istio_registry"></a> Istio Registry Services

The Istio Registry Services won't be available in the service list when the Istio API is disabled. 

The following image shows a service list when Istio API is enabled:

The following image shows the same list when it is disabled: 

<img src="/images/documentation/configuration/registry_services_api_disabled.png" />

### <a name="istio_configurations"></a> Istio Configurations

The Istio Configurations are available in view and edit mode. 
It is important to know that the validations are disabled, so the configurations created or modified won't be validated.  

There is one scenario where the creation/deletion/edition could fail: If the Istio validation webhook is enabled but the Istio registry is not available. In this case, the webhook should be removed in order for this to work. 

It can be checked with the following command: 

```cmd
kubectl get ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
```
