## Contributing to the Docs

To contribute to the kiali.io docs see [kiali.io on github](https://github.com/kiali/kiali.io).

In short you will:

1. Fork the [kiali.io repo](https://github.com/kiali/kiali.io) on GitHub.
1. Make your changes and send a pull request (PR).
1. If you're not yet ready for a review, add "WIP" to the PR name to indicate it's a work in progress.
    1. **Don't** add the Hugo property  "draft = true" to the page front matter, it prevents auto-deployment of the content preview.
1. Wait for the automated PR workflow to do some checks. When it's ready, you should see a comment like this: **deploy/netlify â€” Deploy preview ready!**
1. Click **Details** to the right of "Deploy preview ready" to see a preview of your updates.
1. Continue updating your doc and pushing your changes until you're happy with  the content.

### Updating a single page

1. Click **Edit this page** in the top right hand corner of the page.
1. If you don't already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one:
    1. Click **Fork this repository and propose changes** or **Update your Fork** to get an up to date version of the project to edit.
    1. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode.
1. Follow the steps above to make, preview, and propose your changes.
