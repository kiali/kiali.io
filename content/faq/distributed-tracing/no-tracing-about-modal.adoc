So Kiali didn't find the tracing service. Kiali tries to search for the tracing service in `tracing` or `jaeger-query`. If you have another name for this service you must set the values in the link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali/blob/master/operator/deploy/kiali/kiali_cr.yaml[yaml configuration, window="_blank"] for link:https://operatorhub.io/operator/alpha/kiali-operator[Kiali Operator, window="_blank"]

```yaml
# **Tracing-specific settings:
#  - Right now we only support Jaeger
# namespace: The Kubernetes namespace that holds the Tracing service (if empty, assumes the same value as deployment.namespace)
# service: The Kubernetes service name for tracing. Kiali uses this to connect within the cluster to Jaeger.
# url: The URL that Kiali uses when integrating with Tracing. This URL must be accessible to clients external to
#      the cluster in order for the integration to work properly. If empty, an attempt to auto-discover it is made.

#    tracing:
#      namespace: ""
#      service : ""
#      url: ""
```
