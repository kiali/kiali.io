In order to Kiali enable Jaeger integration, Kiali needs to check the availability of the discovered URL. If that URL uses TLS and the certificate is signed by an untrusted authority, then Kiali can't establish connection with it for security purposes.
However there is a workaround for that. Kiali can be configured to skip the authority verification through the flag: insecure_skip_verify. Change its value to true in the link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali/blob/master/operator/deploy/kiali/kiali_cr.yaml#L262[Kiali CR,window="_blank"].
