Kiali builds the graph from Istio's telemetry.
If you don't see what you expect it probably means that it has not been reported in Prometheus.
This usually means that:

1- The requests are not actually sent.

2- Sidecars are missing.

3- Requests are leaving the mesh and are not configured for telemetry.

For example, If you don't see traffic going from node A to node B, but you are sure there is traffic, the first thing
you should be doing is checking the telemetry by
https://istio.io/docs/tasks/telemetry/metrics/querying-metrics/[querying the metrics], for example, if you know that
MyWorkload-v1 is sending requests to ServiceA  try looking for metrics of the type:

`istio_requests_total{destination_service="ServiceA"}`

If telemetry is missing then it may be better to take it up with https://github.com/istio/istio/issues[Istio]
