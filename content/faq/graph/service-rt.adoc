Users can select _Response Time_ to label their edges with 95th percentile response times.  The response
time indicates the amount of time it took for the destination workload to handle the request.  In the
Kiali graph the edges leading to service nodes represent the request itself, in other words, the routing.
Kiali can show the request rate for a service but response time is not applicable to be shown on the
incoming edge. Only edges to app, workload, or service entry nodes show response time because only those
nodes represent the actual work done to handle the request.  This is why a Service graph will typically
not show any response time information, even when the _Response Time_ option is selected.

Because Service graphs can show Service Entry nodes the _Response Time_ option is still a valid choice.
Edges to Service Entry nodes represent externally handled requests, which do report the response time for
the external handling.
