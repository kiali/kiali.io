When you are using an RBAC-enabled authentication strategy, to login
successfully into Kiali users need the `get namespace` privilege in, at least,
one namespace. Depending on the provided options in the Kiali operator CR, a
`ClusterRole` named either `kiali` or `kiali-viewer` will be available which
has the needed privilege and you can bind users to this role.

If you prefer to use a customized `Role` or `ClusterRole`, make sure it has the
following rule to allow a successfull login into Kiali:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: custom-kiali-role
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources:
  - namespaces
  verbs:
  - get
----

You will need a broader set of privileges for Kiali to be useful, but when
speaking solely about login, this is the required privilge to give access to
Kiali.
