*_This assumes that you have used the
link:{{< ref "/documentation/getting-started" >}}[Getting started instructions] to
install Kiali._*

*If you are using OpenShift*, installation exposes Kiali through a route. The
following command should open Kiali in your default web browser:

[source, bash]
----
xdg-open https://$(oc get routes -n istio-system kiali -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')/console
----

*If you are using Kubernetes*, installation exposes Kiali through an
link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali-operator/blob/master/roles/default/kiali-deploy/templates/kubernetes/ingress.yaml[Ingress
rule]. Find out your Ingress IP or domain name and use it to access Kiali by
visiting this URL in your web browser:
`https://_your_ingress_ip_or_domain_/kiali`.

To find your Ingress IP or domain name, as per
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/ingress-minikube/#create-an-ingress-resource[the
Kubernetes documentation], try the following command (doesn't work if using
Minikube):

[source, bash]
----
kubectl get ingress kiali -n istio-system -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'
----

If it doesn't work, unfortunately, it depends on how and where you had setup
your cluster. There are several Ingress controllers available and some cloud
providers have their own controller or preferred exposure method. Please, check
the documentation of your cloud provider. You may need to customize the
pre-installed Ingress rule, or to expose Kiali using a different method.

*If you are using Minikube* and you have
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/ingress-minikube/#enable-the-ingress-controller[enabled
the Ingress controller], the following command should open Kiali in your
default web browser:

[source, bash]
----
xdg-open https://$(minikube ip)/kiali
----

*In any platform*, you can use port-forwarding to access Kiali. Run any of
these commands:

[source, bash]
----
# If you have oc command line tool
oc port-forward svc/kiali 20001:20001 -n istio-system
# If you have kubectl command line tool
kubectl port-forward svc/kiali 20001:20001 -n istio-system
----

These commands will block. Access Kiali by visiting https://localhost:20001/ in
your preferred web browser.
