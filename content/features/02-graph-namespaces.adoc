The graph can provide a more focused view by only showing the graph for a **single namespace**. Connections which go outside of your namespace are displayed as pentagons and **double clicking** on them will take you to that other namespace.


Want the bigger picture? Just select the **'all'** namespace and get a **cluster** wide view.
