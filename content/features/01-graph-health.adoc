Colors in the graph represent the **health** of your service mesh. If something is red or orange in your service mesh, then it might need attention. The color of the lines between components represents the health of the **requests** between those components. The color of the component's shape represents the **component's** health.

The **side panel** provides more information about a selected item in the graph. You can select an unhealthy node or connection in the graph to view more information in the side panel.
