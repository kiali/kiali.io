The graph provides a powerful way to visualize what is actually happening within your service mesh. In one view you can know what components are **communicating** with each other and where **errors** or **health** issues might be located. The graph lets you see what services are **configured** with such things as virtual services and circuit breakers. And you can observe the **traffic flow** between components by watching the animation or viewing the **metrics**.

You can configure the graph to show the data that is important to you, and display it in the way that best meets your needs.
