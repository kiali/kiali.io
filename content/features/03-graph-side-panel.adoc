Want to know more about something in the graph? Click on it and the side panel will update to provide a brief summary for that component. This includes **charts**, **health** and **links** to get more detailed information.

If nothing is selected, or if the background of the graph is clicked, the side panel will provide an overall summary for the whole graph.
