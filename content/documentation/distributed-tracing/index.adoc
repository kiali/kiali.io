Kiali shows tracing of your applications. We currently support link:https://www.jaegertracing.io[Jaeger, window="_blank"] version 1.9 and newer.



== Configuration

=== In cluster URL

In order to fetch data from Jaeger, Kiali needs to get an URL that can be resolved from inside the cluster, typically using Kubernetes DNS. This is the in_cluster_url configuration. For instance, for a Jaeger service named `tracing` within `istio-system` namespace, Kiali config would be:

```yaml
  external_services:
    tracing:
      in_cluster_url: 'http://tracing.istio-system/jaeger'
```

icon:bullhorn[size=2x]{nbsp} If you use the Kiali operator (recommended), this config can be set in the Kiali CR. But in most cases, the Kiali operator will set a valid default in_cluster_url so you wouldn't have to change anything. If you don't use the Kiali operator, this config can be set in Kiali config map.

Once the in_cluster_url setting is set on the Kiali CR, each service page will have the new Traces tab where a scatter plot will be displayed with its related traces.

We can interact with the jaeger UI with the external links, for example "View Trace in Tracing" goes to the Jaeger UI trace view.

== External URL

Configuring an external URL for Jaeger will enable more links from Kiali to Jaeger UI. This URL needs to be accessible from the browser (it's used for links generation). Example:

```yaml
  external_services:
    tracing:
      in_cluster_url: 'http://tracing.istio-system/jaeger'
      url: 'http://my-jaeger-host'
```

Once the url setting is set on the Kiali CR, Kiali will show...

icon:bullhorn[size=2x]{nbsp} You may have `url` configured and not `in_cluster_url`, for instance, if Jaeger is not accessible from Kiali pod. In this situation, Kiali will not show its own traces chart but will display external links to the Jaeger UI instead.

=== Other configuration

For advanced configuration on Jaeger integration, please refer to link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali/blob/c78f195fcbe214e56a918d616ed2f241be24c968/operator/deploy/kiali/kiali_cr.yaml#L433-L470[the Kiali CR description, window="_blank"]. It is relevant for config map as well, if you don't use the Kiali operator.


== Tracing Toolbar

Kiali has a toolbar to control this feature to facilitate the user experience with the tracing service. When we go to the tracing view we'll a form as the image below where we can select the traces interval, results limit, status code, errors, adjust time (expand results on time), last Xm traffic (Traces from last minutes) and refresh time.

=== Tracing Results

When user select a trace kiali shows the information related to that trace like number of spans, spans grouped by operation name, duration, date...

In each span, tags and process are displayed.
