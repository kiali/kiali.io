title: Why is the graph badly laid out?
weight: 20
---

The layout for a Kiali Graph may render differently, depending on the data to display (number of graph nodes and their interactions) and it's sometimes difficult, not to say impossible,
to have a single layout that renders nicely in every situation.
That's why Kiali offers a choice of several layout algorithms. However, we may still find some scenarios where none of the proposed algorithms offer a satisfying display.
If Kiali doesn't render your graph layout in a satisfactory manner please switch to another layout option.
This can be done from the _Graph Toolbar_ located on the bottom left of the graph.


If Kiali doesn't produce a good graph for you, don't hesitate to https://github.com/kiali/kiali/issues/new?template=bug_report.md[open an issue in GitHub] or reach out via the usual channels.
