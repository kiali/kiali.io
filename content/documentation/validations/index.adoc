== AuthorizationPolicy
=== KIA0101 - Namespace not found for this rule

AuthorizationPolicy enables access control on workloads. Each policy effects only to a group of request. For instance, all requests started from a workload on a list of namespaces.
The present validation points out those rules referencing a namespace that don't exist in the cluster.

==== Resolution

Either remove the namespace from the list, correct if there is any typo or create a new namespace.

==== Severity

'''

=== KIA0102 - Only HTTP methods and fully-qualified gRPC names are allowed

An AuthorizationPolicy has an Operation field where is defined the oprations allowed for a request. In the method field are listed all the allowed methods that request can have.
This validation appears when a problem is found in there. The only methods accepted are: either HTTP valid methods or fully-qualified names of gRPC service in the form of "/package.service/method"

==== Resolution

Either change or remove the violating method. It has to be either a HTTP valid method or a fully-qualified names of a gRPC service in the form of "/package.service/method"

=== KIA0103 - No matching workload found for authorization policy selector in this namespace

The selector field decides where to apply the rules of the authorization policy. The validation appears when the labels specified don't match with any workload listed in the same namespace. Cross-namespace validations are not supported.

==== Resolution

Make sure you have at least a workload that its labels matches with the selector labels of the Authorization Policy.

=== KIA0104 - This host has no matching entry in the service registry

AuthorizationPolicy enables access control on workloads. Each policy effects only to a group of request going to a specific destination. For instance, allow all the request going to `details` host.

The present validation points out those rules referencing a host that don't exist in the authorization policy namespace. Kiali considers services and service entries.
Those hosts that refers to hosts outside of the object namespace will be presented with an unknow error.

[#destinationrules]
== Destination rules

=== KIA0201 - More than one DestinationRules for the same host subset combination

Istio applies traffic rules for services after the routing has happened. These can include different settings such as connection pooling, circuit breakers, load balancing, and detection. Istio can define the same rules for all services under a host or different rules for different versions of the service.

This validation warning could be a result of duplicate definition of the same subsets as well as from rules that apply to all subsets. Also, a combination of one Destination Rule (DR) applying to all subsets and another defining behavior for only some subsets triggers this validation warning.

Istio silently ignores the duplicate subsets and merge these destination rules without letting the user know. Only the first seen rule (by Istio) per subset is used and information from multiple definitions is not merged. While the routing might work correctly, this is most likely a configuration error. It may lead to a undesired behavior if one of the offending rules is removed or modified and that is probably not the intention of the deployer of this service. Also, if the two offending destination rules have different policies for traffic routing the wrong one might be used.

==== Resolution

Either merge the settings to a single DR or split the subsets in such a way that they do not interleave. This ensures that the routing behavior stays consistent.

Istio applies traffic rules for services after the routing has happened. These can include different settings such as connection pooling, circuit breakers, load balancing, and detection. Istio can define the same rules for all services under a host or different rules for different versions of the service. The host must a service that is defined in the platform's service registry or as a ServiceEntry.

=== KIA0204 - mTLS settings of a non-local Destination Rule are overridden

Istio allows you to define DestinationRule at three different levels: mesh, namespace and service level. A mesh may have multiple DRs. In case of having two DestinationRules on the first one is at a lower level than the second one, the first one overrides the TLS values of the second one.

==== Resolution

This validation aims to warn Kiali users that they may be disabling/enabling mTLS from the higher DestinationRule.
Merging the TLS settings to one of the DestinationRules is the only way to fix this validation. However, this is a valid scenario so it might be impossible to remove this warning.

The MeshPolicy defines what authentication methods can be accepted on the workload of the whole mesh.
If the MeshPolicy is not found or doesn't exist and the mesh-wide DestinationRule is on ISTIO_MUTUAL mode, all the communication returns 500 errors.

=== KIA0206 - PeerAuthentication enabling namespace-wide mTLS is missing

Istio has the ability to define mTLS communications at namespace level. In order to do that, Istio needs both a DestinationRule and a Policy targeting all the clients/workloads of the specific namespace. The policy allows mTLS authentication method for all the workloads within a namespace. The DestinationRule defines all the clients within the namespace to start communications in mTLS mode.
If the Policy is not found and the DestinationRule is on STRICT mode in that namespace, all the communications within that namespace returns 500 errors.

==== Resolution
A Policy enabling mTLS method is needed for the workloads in the namespace. Otherwise all the clients start mTLS connections that those workloads won't be ready to manage.

=== KIA0301 - More than one Gateway for the same host port combination

Gateway creates a proxy that forwards the inbound traffic for the exposed ports. If two different gateways expose the same ports for the same host, this creates ambiguity inside Istio as either of these gateways could handle the traffic. This is most likely a configuration error.

Istio requires the service ports to follow the naming form of 'protocol-suffix' where the '-suffix' part is optional. If the naming does not match this form (or is undefined), Istio treats all the traffic TCP instead of the defined protocol in the definition. Dash is a required character between protocol and suffix. For example, 'http2foo' is not valid, while 'http2-foo' is (for http2 protocol).

Therefore, this validation refers to the scenario where there are more than one sidecar targetting to all workloads of the namespace. According to Istio documentation the behavior of the mesh is undefined when this scenario is presented.

==== Resolution

Make sure that all that there is only one selector-less sidecar in the namespace. Three possible solutions are suggested: merging selector-less sidecars into one, adding selectors to existing selector-less sidecars or removing selector-less sidecars.

=== KIA1004 - This host has no matching entry in the service registry

The Sidecar resources are used for configuring the sidecar proxies in the service mesh. IstioEgressListener specifies the properties of an outbound traffic listener on the sidecar proxy attached to a workload instance.

In the hosts field, there is the list of hosts exposed to the workload. Each host in the list have the `namespace/dnsName` format where both namespace and dnsName may have non-obvious values. `namespace` may be either `.`, `~`, `*` or an actual namespace name. `dnsName` has to be a FQDN representing a service, virtual service or a service entry. This FQDN may use the wildcard character.

See more information about the syntax of both `namespace` and `dnsName` into https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/networking/sidecar/#IstioEgressListener[istio documentation].

=== KIA1005 - More than one Sidecar applied to the same workload

The Sidecar resources are used for configuring the sidecar proxies in the service mesh. The `workloadSelector` field is the set of labels that selects which workloads' sidecars this resource will be applied to.

The behavior of the system is undefined if two or more Sidecar configurations with a workloadSelector select the same workload instance. It means that Istio undeterministicly applies one sidecar or another to a set of workloads. This scenario is very unlikely and it should be prevented.

==== Resolution

Make sure the labels for the sidecar are applying to a unique set of workloads. Ensure that other sidecars in the namespace are not targetting workloads targetted in this sidecar.

=== KIA1006 - Global default sidecar should not have workloadSelector

The Sidecar resources are used for configuring the sidecar proxies in the service mesh. By default, all the sidecars are configured with the default sidecar instance specified in the control plane namespace (usually istio-system). In case there are sidecar resources in the namespaces where your applications are, this default sidecar resource won't be considered. The sidecar in your namespace will be applied.

Having `workloadSelector` in your global default sidecar won't make any effect in the other sidecars living outside of the control plane namespace.

==== Resolution

Make sure you don't have the `workloadSelector` in this global sidecar resource. In case you need specific settings for specific workloads, move those settings to the sidecar resources in your application namespaces.

== VirtualServices

=== KIA1101 - DestinationWeight on route doesn't have a valid service (host not found)

VirtualService routes matching requests to a service inside your mesh. Routing can also match a subset of traffic to a certain version of it for example. Any service inside the mesh must be targeted by its name, the IP address are only allowed for hosts defined through a Gateway. Host must be in a short name or FQDN format. Short name will evaluate to VS' namespace, regardless of where the actual service might be placed.

If the host is not found, Istio ignores the defined rules. However, if a subset with a Destination Rule is not found it affects all the subsets and all the routings. As such, care must be taken that the Destination rule is available before deploying the Virtual Service.

==== Resolution

Correct the host to point to a correct service (in this namespace or with FQDN to other namespaces), deploy the missing service to the mesh or remove the configuration linking to that non-existing service.

=== KIA1102 - VirtualService is pointing to a non-existent gateway

By default, VirtualService routes apply to sidecars inside the mesh. The gateway field allows to override that default and if anything is defined, the VS applies to those selected. 'mesh' is a reserved gateway name and means all the sidecars in the mesh. If one wishes to apply the VS to gateways as well as the sidecars, the 'mesh' keyword must be used as one of the gateways. Incorrect gateways mean that the VS is not applied correctly.

==== Resolution

Fix the possible gateway field to target all necessary gateways or remove the field if the default 'mesh' is enough.

=== KIA1105 - This subset is already referenced in another route destination

Istio allows you to apply rules over the traffic targetting to a specific service. In order to achieve that, it is necessary to add those rules into either _http_, _tcp_ or _tls_ fields in a VirtualService. In each field it is possible to specify rules for redirection or forwarding traffic. Those rules are the _RouteDestination_ and _HTTPRouteDestination_ structs. Each structs defines where the traffic is shifted to using the _subset_ field. +
This warning message refers to the fact of referencing one subset more than one time within the same route. Galley, Istio module in charge of configuration validation, allows the subset duplicity. However, the mesh it might become broken when there are different duplicates. Also, the presented warning might help spoting a typo.

==== Resolution

Make sure there is only one reference to the same subset for each RouteDestination.

=== KIA1106 - More than one Virtual Service for same host

A VirtualService defines a set of traffic routing rules to apply when a host is addressed. Each routing rule defines matching criteria for traffic of a specific protocol. If the traffic is matched, then it is sent to a named destination service (or subset/version of it) defined in the registry.

==== Resolution

This is valid configuration only if VirtualService is bound to a gateway, sidecars do not accept this behavior. There are several caveats when using this method and defining the same parts in multiple Virtual Service definitions is not recommended. While Istio will merge the configuration, it does not guarantee any ordering for cross-resource merging and only the first seen configuration is applied (rest ignored). As recommended, each VS definition should have a 'catch-all' situation, but this can only be defined in a definition affecting the same host.

=== KIA0001 - Unable to verify the validity, cross-namespace validation is not supported for this field

In certain cases, Kiali is unable to validate the field since it spans another namespace to which the validator is not capable of looking at. In such cases, Kiali will mark this field with a grey icon indicating that the fields correctness could not be verified. This does not necessarily mean there is an error, but that the user should be careful and do the validation manually.
