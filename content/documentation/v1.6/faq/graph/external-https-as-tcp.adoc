Istio can't recognize HTTPS request that go directly to the service, the reason is that these
requests are encrypted and are recognized as TCP traffic.

You can however configure your
https://istio.io/docs/tasks/traffic-management/egress/egress-tls-origination/#tls-origination-for-egress-traffic[mesh] to
use TLS origination for your egress traffic. This will allow to see your traffic as HTTP instead of TCP.
