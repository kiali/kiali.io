Kiali queries *Deployment* ,*ReplicaSet*, *ReplicationController*, *DeploymentConfig*, *StatefulSet*, *Job* and *CronJob* controllers.
*Deployment*, *ReplicaSet* and *StatefulSet* are always queried, but _ReplicationController_, _DeploymentConfig_, _Job_ and _CronJobs_
are excluded by default for performance reasons.

To include them, update the list of link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali-operator/blob/master/deploy/kiali/kiali_cr.yaml#L687["excluded_workloads"] from the Kiali config.

```
...
#    ---
#    excluded_workloads:
#    - "CronJob"
#    - "DeploymentConfig"
#    - "Job"
#    - "ReplicationController"
#
...
```

An empty list will tell Kiali to query all type of known controllers.
