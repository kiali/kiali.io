Kiali can display custom dashboards to monitor application metrics. They are available for Applications and Workloads.

icon:bullhorn[size=2x]{nbsp} To display custom dashboards, you must set the _app_ and _version_ labels on your pods. These labels are necessary for Kiali to identify which application and workload the metrics originate from.

== Prometheus Configuration

Kiali runtimes monitoring feature works exclusively with Prometheus, so it must be configured correctly to pull your application metrics.

If you are using the default Istio installation, your Prometheus instance should already be configured as shown below and you can skip to the next section.

But if you want to use another Prometheus instance, please refer to link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#kubernetes_sd_config[Prometheus documentation] to setup `kubernetes_sd_config` for pods. As a reference, link:https://github.com/istio/istio/blob/907aa731c3f76ad21faac98614751e8ab3531893/install/kubernetes/helm/istio/charts/prometheus/templates/configmap.yaml#L229[here is] how it is configured in Istio.

It is important to preserve label mapping, so that Kiali can filter on _app_ and _version_, which is done with this configuration:

```yaml
      - action: labelmap
        regex: __meta_kubernetes_pod_label_(.+)
```

Additionally, you must configure the Prometheus server URL in the _Kiali CR_:

```yaml
# ...
external_services:
  prometheus:
    custom_metrics_url: URL_TO_SERVER
# ...
```

Make sure that Kiali pod can reach this URL.

[#pods-annotations]
== Pods Annotations and Auto-discovery

Application pods must be annotated for the Prometheus scraper, for example, within a _Deployment_ definition:

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
        prometheus.io/port: "8080"
        prometheus.io/scheme: http
        prometheus.io/path: "/metrics"
```

* _prometheus.io/scrape_ tells Prometheus to fetch these metrics or not
* _prometheus.io/port_ is the port under which metrics are exposed
* _prometheus.io/scheme_ must be set to http for non-secure or https for secure connection
* _prometheus.io/path_ is the endpoint path where metrics are exposed, default is /metrics

Kiali will try to discover automatically dashboards that are relevant for a given Application or Workload. To do so, it reads their metrics and try to match them with the `discoverOn` field defined on dashboards.

But if you can't rely on automatic discovery, you can explicitly annotate the pods to associate them with Kiali dashboards.

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        # (prometheus annotations...)
        kiali.io/runtimes: vertx-server
```

_kiali.io/runtimes_ is a coma-separated list of runtimes / dashboards that Kiali will look for

== Default dashboards

Since version 0.15, Kiali comes with a set of default dashboards for various runtimes. We keep adding new ones over time.

=== Go

Contains metrics such as the number of threads, goroutines, and heap usage. The expected metrics are provided by the link:https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/go-application/[Prometheus Go client].

Example to expose default Go metrics:

```go
        http.Handle("/metrics", promhttp.Handler())
        http.ListenAndServe(":2112", nil)
```

As an example and for self-monitoring purpose Kiali itself link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali/blob/055b593e52ebf8a0eb00372bca71fbef94230f0f/server/metrics_server.go[exposes Go metrics].

The pod annotation for Kiali is: `kiali.io/runtimes: go`

=== Node.js

Contains metrics such as active handles, event loop lag, and heap usage. The expected metrics are provided by link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/prom-client[prom-client].

Example of Node.js metrics for Prometheus:

```javascript
const client = require('prom-client');
client.collectDefaultMetrics();
// ...
app.get('/metrics', (request, response) => {
  response.set('Content-Type', client.register.contentType);
  response.send(client.register.metrics());
});
```

Full working example: https://github.com/jotak/bookinfo-runtimes/tree/master/ratings

The pod annotation for Kiali is: `kiali.io/runtimes: nodejs`

=== Quarkus

Contains JVM-related, GC usage metrics. The expected metrics can be provided by link:https://smallrye.io/[SmallRye Metrics], a MicroProfile Metrics implementation. Example with maven:

```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
      <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-metrics</artifactId>
    </dependency>
```

The pod annotation for Kiali is: `kiali.io/runtimes: quarkus`

=== Spring Boot

Three dashboards are provided: one for JVM memory / threads, another for JVM buffer pools and the last one for Tomcat metrics. The expected metrics come from link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-metrics.html#production-ready-metrics-export-prometheus[Spring Boot Actuator for Prometheus]. Example with maven:

```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
      <artifactId>micrometer-core</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
      <artifactId>micrometer-registry-prometheus</artifactId>
    </dependency>
```

Full working example: https://github.com/jotak/bookinfo-runtimes/tree/master/details

The pod annotation for Kiali with the full list of dashboards is: `kiali.io/runtimes: springboot-jvm,springboot-jvm-pool,springboot-tomcat`

By default, the metrics are exposed on path _/actuator/prometheus_, so it must be specified in the corresponding annotation: `prometheus.io/path: "/actuator/prometheus"`

=== Thorntail

Contains mostly JVM-related metrics such as loaded classes count, memory usage, etc. The expected metrics are provided by the MicroProfile Metrics module. Example with maven:

```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.thorntail</groupId>
      <artifactId>microprofile-metrics</artifactId>
    </dependency>
```

Full working example: https://github.com/jotak/bookinfo-runtimes/tree/master/productpage

The pod annotation for Kiali is: `kiali.io/runtimes: thorntail`

=== Vert.x

Several dashboards are provided, related to different components in Vert.x: HTTP client/server metrics, Net client/server metrics, Pools usage, Eventbus metrics and JVM. The expected metrics are provided by the link:https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-micrometer-metrics/java/[vertx-micrometer-metrics] module. Example with maven:

```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
      <artifactId>vertx-micrometer-metrics</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
      <artifactId>micrometer-registry-prometheus</artifactId>
    </dependency>
```

Init example of Vert.x metrics, starting a dedicated server (other options are possible):

```java
      VertxOptions opts = new VertxOptions().setMetricsOptions(new MicrometerMetricsOptions()
          .setPrometheusOptions(new VertxPrometheusOptions()
              .setStartEmbeddedServer(true)
              .setEmbeddedServerOptions(new HttpServerOptions().setPort(9090))
              .setPublishQuantiles(true)
              .setEnabled(true))
          .setEnabled(true));
```

Full working example: https://github.com/jotak/bookinfo-runtimes/tree/master/reviews

The pod annotation for Kiali with the full list of dashboards is: `kiali.io/runtimes: vertx-client,vertx-server,vertx-eventbus,vertx-pool,vertx-jvm`

== Create new dashboards

The default dashboards described above are just examples of what we can have. It's pretty easy to create new dashboards.

When installing Kiali, a new CRD is installed in the system: _monitoringdashboard.monitoring.kiali.io_. It declares the resource kind _MonitoringDashboard_. Here's what this resource looks like:

```yaml
apiVersion: "monitoring.kiali.io/v1alpha1"
kind: MonitoringDashboard
metadata:
  name: vertx-custom
spec:
  runtime: Vert.x
  title: Vert.x Metrics
  discoverOn: "vertx_http_server_connections"
  items:
  - chart:
      name: "Server response time"
      unit: "seconds"
      spans: 6
      metricName: "vertx_http_server_responseTime_seconds"
      dataType: "histogram"
      aggregations:
      - label: "path"
        displayName: "Path"
      - label: "method"
        displayName: "Method"
  - chart:
      name: "Server active connections"
      unit: ""
      spans: 6
      metricName: "vertx_http_server_connections"
      dataType: "raw"
  - include: "micrometer-1.1-jvm"
```

The *name* field (from metadata) corresponds to what you can set in pods annotation link:#pods-annotations[`kiali.io/runtimes`].

Spec fields definitions are:

* *runtime*: name of the related runtime. It will be displayed on the corresponding Workload Details page. If omitted no name is displayed.
* *title*: dashboard title, displayed as a tab in Application or Workloads Details
* *discoverOn*: metric name to match for auto-discovery. If omitted, the dashboard won't be discovered automatically, but can still be used via pods annotation.
* *items*: can be either *chart*, to define a new chart, or *include* to reference another dashboard
** *chart*: new chart object
*** *name*: name of the chart
*** *chartType*: type of the chart, can be one of _line_ (default), _area_ or _bar_
*** *unit*: unit for Y-axis. Free-text field to provide any unit suffix. It can eventually be scaled on display. See link:#units[specific section below].
*** *spans*: number of "spans" taken by the chart, from 1 to 12, using link:https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_grid_system.asp[bootstrap convention]
*** *metricName*: the metric name in Prometheus
*** *dataType*: type of data to be displayed in the chart. Can be one of _raw_, _rate_ or _histogram_. Raw data will be queried without transformation. Rate data will be queried using link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/functions/#rate[_promQL rate() function_]. And histogram with link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/functions/#histogram_quantile[_histogram_quantile() function_].
*** *min* and *max*: domain for Y-values. When unset, charts implementations should usually automatically adapt the domain with the displayed data.
*** *aggregator*: defines how the time-series are aggregated when several are returned for a given metric and label set. For example, if a Deployment creates a ReplicaSet of several Pods, you will have at least one time-series per Pod. Since Kiali shows the dashboards at the workload (ReplicaSet) level or at the application level, they will have to be aggregated. This field can be used to fix the aggregator, with values such as _sum_ or _avg_ (full list available link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/operators/#aggregation-operators[in Prometheus documentation]). However, if omitted the aggregator will default to _sum_ and can be changed from the dashboard UI.
*** *aggregations*: list of labels eligible for aggregations / groupings (they will be displayed in Kiali through a dropdown list)
**** *label*: Prometheus label name
**** *displayName*: Name to display in Kiali
** *include*: to include another dashboard, or a specific chart from another dashboard. Typically used to compose with generic dashboards such as the ones about _MicroProfile Metrics_ or _Micrometer_-based JVM metrics. To reference a full dashboard, set the name of that dashboard. To reference a specific chart of another dashboard, set the name of the dashboard followed by `$` and the name of the chart (ex: `include: "microprofile-1.1$Thread count"`).
* *externalLinks*: a list of related external links (e.g. to Grafana dashboards)
** *name*: link name to be displayed
** *type*: link type, currently only _grafana_ is allowed
** *variables*: a set of variables that can be injected in the URL. For instance, with something like _namespace: var-namespace_ and _app: var-app_, an URL to a Grafana dashboard that manages _namespace_ and _app_ variables would look like:
_http://grafana-server:3000/d/xyz/my-grafana-dashboard?var-namespace=some-namespace&var-app=some-app_. The available variables in this context are *namespace*, *app* and *version*.

icon:bullhorn[size=2x]{nbsp} *Label clash*: you should try to avoid labels clashes within a dashboard.
In Kiali, labels for grouping are aggregated in the top toolbar, so if the same label refers to different things depending on the metric, you wouldn't be able to distinguish them in the UI. For that reason, ideally, labels should not have too generic names in Prometheus.
For instance labels named "id" for both memory spaces and buffer pools would better be named "space_id" and "pool_id". If you have control on label names, it's an important aspect to take into consideration.
Else, it is up to you to organize dashboards with that in mind, eventually splitting them into smaller ones to resolve clashes.

Dashboard resources are added in Kubernetes just like any other resource:

```bash
kubectl apply -f mydashboard.yml
```

Or for OpenShift:

```bash
oc apply -f mydashboard.yml
```

To make the dashboard resources available cluster-wide, just create them in Kiali namespace (usually _istio-system_). Else, they will be available only for applications or workloads of the same namespace. In the case where the same dashboard name exists in a specific namespace and in Kiali namespace, the former takes precedence.

[#units]
== Units

Some units are recognized in Kiali and scaled appropriately when displayed on charts:

* `unit: "seconds"` can be scaled down to `ms`, `µs`, etc.
* `unit: "bytes-si"` and `unit: "bitrate-si"` can be scaled up to `kB`, `MB` (etc.) using link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units[SI / metric system]. The aliases `unit: "bytes"` and `unit: "bitrate"` can be used instead.
* `unit: "bytes-iec"` and `unit: "bitrate-iec"` can be scaled up to `KiB`, `MiB` (etc.) using link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_1541-2002[IEC standard / IEEE 1541-2002] (scale by powers of 2).

Other units will fall into the default case and be scaled using SI standard. For instance, `unit: "m"` for meter can be scaled up to `km`.
