This section describes some known issues in Kiali that may not be fixed in the very short term, and lead to limitations in a restricted number of corner cases. Hopefully, you wouldn't even notice them.

If you are hitting a limitation, regardless if it's listed here or not, do not hesitate to use the https://github.com/kiali/kiali/issues[GitHub issue tracker]. You can simply _vote_ (using emojis) for any existing bug or feature request, this will help us to understand the most demanded enhancements, or you can create a new ticket. For existing JIRA tickets, use the _vote_ link or add a comment describing your expectation or scenario.

The whole list of JIRA tickets can be found https://issues.jboss.org/projects/KIALI/issues/[here].

icon:lightbulb[size=2x] {nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} In general, we use the GitHub tracker for issues raised by the community, and JIRA for issues raised by the core engineering team. Both are publicly accessible.

== Accessing Kiali with Internet Explorer

No version of Internet Explorer is supported with Kiali. Users may experience some https://github.com/kiali/kiali/issues/507[issues] when using Kiali through this browser.

In order to have the best experience with Kiali you will need to update to use a link:../prerequisites/#_browser_requirements[supported browser].

== Graph badly laid out

If you search in the https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/kiali-dev/[mailing list], you will find a number of discussions about the graph layouts.

The layout for Kiali Graph may render differently, depending on the data to display (number of graph nodes and their interactions) and it's sometimes difficult, not to say impossible, to have a single layout that renders nicely in every situations. That's why Kiali offers a choice of several layout algorithms. However, we may still find some scenarios where none of the proposed algorithm offer a satisfying display. If Kiali doesn't not render your graph layout in a satisfactory manner please switch to another layout option. This can be done from the _Graph Settings_ dropdown by changing the _Layout Schema_.

icon:info[size=2x] {nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} If Kiali doesn't produce a good graph for you, don't hesitate to https://github.com/kiali/kiali/issues/new?template=bug_report.md[open an issue in GitHub] or reach us in the https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kiali-users[mailing lists], and describe your situation.

== Many "unknown" connections in the graph

In some situations you can see a lot of connections from an "Unknown" node to your services in the graph, because some software external to your mesh might be periodically pinging or fetching data. This is typically the case when you setup Kubernetes liveness probes, or have some application metrics pushed or exposed to a monitoring system such as Prometheus. Perhaps you wouldn't like to see these connections because they make the graph harder to read.

From the Graph page, you can filter them out by typing `node = unknown` in the _Graph Hide_ input box.

For a more definitive solution, there are several ways to prevent Istio from gathering this kind of telemetry.

The first is to have these endpoints (like `/health` or `/metrics`) exposed on a different port and server than your main application, and to _not_ declare this port in your _Pod_'s container definition as _containerPort_. This way, the requests will be completely ignored by the Istio proxy, as mentioned in link:https://istio.io/docs/tasks/traffic-management/app-health-check/#liveness-and-readiness-probes-with-http-request-option[Istio documentation] (at the bottom of that page).

The second way is to modify Istio's Prometheus rule to explicitly exclude some requests based on the User Agent. This is the `Rule` resource named `promhttp` located in `istio-system`. To edit it:

```bash
kubectl edit rule promhttp -n istio-system
```

or for OpenShift:

```bash
oc edit rule promhttp -n istio-system
```

Then locate the `match` field under `spec` section. Change it to filter out, for instance, the Kubernetes probes:

```yaml
match: (context.protocol == "http" || context.protocol == "grpc") && (match((request.useragent | "-"), "kube-probe*") == false)
```

Note that, starting from Istio 1.1, link:https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/10480[Kubernetes probes will be filtered out] in that way by default. But you may still want to do something equivalent with other User Agents.
