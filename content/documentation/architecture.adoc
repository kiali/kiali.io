= Kiali architecture
:imagesdir: /images/documentation/architecture

Kiali is composed of two components: a back-end application running in the
container application platform, and a user-facing front-end application.
Kiali depends on external services and components provided by the
container application platform and Istio.

The following diagram illustrates the components involved in Kiali and its
interactions:

== Kiali back-end

The back-end is the application that runs in the container application platform.
It's written in http://golang.org/[Go]. The code can be found at
https://github.com/kiali/kiali[kiali/kiali GitHub repository].

This is the component that communicates with Istio parts, retrieves and
processes data, and exposes this data to the front-end.

The back-end doesn't need storage. When running the back-end locally (which
is for development purposes only), configurations are set in either a config
file or environment variables, including the user name
and password used for authentication. When deploying the back-end to a cluster
using the docker images (the typical production deployment model),
a configmap and secrets are used to set the configurations.

== Kiali front-end

The front-end is a single page web application, built with React and written in
Typescript. The code can be found at
https://github.com/kiali/kiali-ui[kiali/kiali-ui GitHub repository].

In a standard deployment, the back-end serves the front-end. Then, the front-end
queries the Kiali back-end in order to get data and present it to the user. 

Since, currently, there are no options for personalizations, it's mainly
stateless. Some data may be persisted, such as session credentials, but this
data is stored in the browser and won't be available in other browsers nor
other devices.

== Istio

Istio is a Kiali requirement. It provides and controls the
service mesh. Although Kiali and Istio can be installed separately, Kiali
depends on Istio and won't work if it's not present.

Kiali needs to retrieve Istio data and configurations, which are exposed
through Prometheus and the cluster API. This is the reason the diagram shows a
dashed line: to denote indirect dependency.

== Prometheus

Prometheus is an Istio dependency. When Istio telemetry is enabled, metrics
data is stored in Prometheus. Kiali uses the data stored in Prometheus to
figure out the mesh topology, show metrics, calculate health, show possible
problems, etc.

Kiali communicates directly with Prometheus and assumes the data schema used by
Istio Telemetery. It's a hard dependency for Kiali, and most of it's
features do not work without it.

Currently, Kiali relies on
https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/policy-and-telemetry/metrics/[Istio's
default metrics] set. Make sure that these default metrics are always in place.
Custom metrics are not supported by Kiali. If you need custom metrics or a
variant of the default ones, create new Istio metrics with custom names.

== Cluster API

Kiali uses the API of the container application platform (cluster API) in order
to fetch and resolve service mesh configurations.

Container application platforms where Kiali is known to work are
http://www.okd.io/[OKD] and http://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes]. Kiali shoud also
work on the derivatives of these platforms. If you want to learn the cluster
API, check the https://docs.okd.io/latest/rest_api/index.html[OKD REST API
reference] and the
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/[Kubernetes API reference].

Kiali queries the cluster API to retrieve, for example, definitions for 
namespaces, services, deployments, pods, and other entities. Kiali also makes
queries to resolve relationships between the different cluster entities.

The cluster API is also queried to retrieve Istio configurations like virtual
services, destination rules, route rules, gateways, and quotas.

== Jaeger

Jaeger is optional. When available, Kiali will be able to direct the user to
Jaeger's tracing data. If you need this feature, make sure Kiali is
https://github.com/kiali/kiali#jaeger[properly configured for Jaeger
integration].

Tracing data will be available only if
https://istio.io/docs/tasks/telemetry/distributed-tracing/[Istio's distributed
tracing] is enabled. 


== Grafana

Grafana is optional. When available, the metrics pages of Kiali will show a
link to direct the user to the same metric in Grafana. If you need this
feature, make sure Kiali is https://github.com/kiali/kiali#grafana[properly
configured for Grafana integration].

Kiali has basic metric capabilities. It can show the default Istio metrics for
workloads, apps and services. It allows to apply some groupings to the provided
metrics and fetch metrics for different time ranges. However, Kiali doesn't
allow to customize the views nor customize the Prometheus queries. If you need
these capabilities, you'll want to install Grafana. Follow the Istio
documentation to install Grafana if you need it.
