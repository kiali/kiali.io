= Overview
Kiali helps you define, validate, and observe your service mesh.

== Observability
Observability is being able to see your service mesh in operation.  It combines topology, traces, telemetry, logs and definitions. It help you ensure your mesh is healthy or  quickly identify problem areas.


=== Graph

image:graph-overview-thumb.png[float=right, link="{imagesdir}graph-overview.png"]
The graph provides a powerful way to visualize the topology of your service mesh.  It shows you which services communicate with each other and the **traffic rates** and **latencies** between them.  It lets you visually identify problem areas ane quickly pinpoint issues.  Kiali provides **four different graph types** giving you a high-level view of service interactions, a low level view of pods, or a logical view of applications.

The graph also lets you see which services are **configured** with such things as virtual services and circuit breakers. It also identifies **security** issues by identifying traffic not configured as expected.  And you can observe the **traffic flow** between components by watching the animation or viewing the **metrics**.

You can configure the graph to show the namespaces and data that is important to you, and display it in the way that best meets your needs.

==== Graph: Health

image:graph-health-thumb.png[float=right, link="{imagesdir}graph-health.png"]
Colors in the graph represent the **health** of your service mesh. A nodes colored as red or orange may need attention. The color of an edge between components represents the health of the **requests** between those components. The node shape indicates the type of component, services, workloads, apps, etc.

The health of nodes and edges is **refreshed automatically** based on the user's preference.  The graph can also be paused to examine a particular state.

The **side panel** provides more detailed information about the overall traffic. Just **select a node** to have the side-panel show detailed information about that node and its incoming and outgoing traffic.  You can select an unhealthy node or edge to quickly learn more about a potential problem.

The side-panel also provides links to full detail views.

==== Graph: Drill-Down

image:graph-detailed-thumb.png[float=right, link="{imagesdir}graph-detailed.png"]
Sometimes you want to want to focus on just one component, whether it be a service, a workload, or an application.  Kiali offers detail graphs for any component you choose

Double click on a graph node and Kiali will drill in and give you a detailed view centered on that component.  It shows you only the incoming requests being served, and the outgoing requests being made.  All from the point-of-view of that component's telemetry.

You can jump back to the main graph and continue where you left off.

==== Graph: Side-Panel

image:graph-side-panel-thumb.png[float=right, link="{imagesdir}graph-side-panel.png"]
Want to get a quick summary of anything in the graph? Select any node with a single-click and the side panel will update to provide a brief summary for that component. This includes:

* **Charts** showing traffic and response times
* **Health** details
* **Links** to fully-detailed pages
* **Response Code** breakdowns.

Or, click on the graph background and the side panel provides an overall summary for the entire graph.

{empty} +

==== Graph: Traffic Animation

video::kiali_traffic_animation_thumb.mp4[options="autoplay,loop"]
Kiali offers several display options for the graph, including traffic animation.

For HTTP traffic, circles represent successful requests while red diamonds represent errors. The more dense the circles and diamonds the higher the **request rate**. The faster the animation the faster the **response times**.

TCP traffic is represented by offset circles where the speed of the circles indicates the traffic speed.

==== Graph: Graph Types

image:graph-types-thumb.png[float=right, link="{imagesdir}graph-types.png"]
Kiali offers four different graph renderings of the mesh telemetry. Each graph type provides a different view of the traffic.

* The **workload** graph provides the a detailed view of communication between workloads/pods.

* The **app** graph aggregates the workloads with the same app labeling, providing a more logical view.

* The **versioned app** graph aggregates by app, but breaks out the different versions providing traffic breakdowns that are version-specific.

* The **service** graph provides a high-level view, aggregating all traffic for defined services.

=== Detail Views

video::applications_workloads_services_overview-thumb.mp4[opts="autoplay,loop", link="{imagesdir}applications_workloads_services_overview.mp4"]
Kiali provides filtered list views of all your service mesh definitions.  Each view provides health, details, yamls and links to help you visualize your mesh. There are list and detail views for:

* Services
* Applications
* Workloads
* Istio Configurations (Virtual Services, Gateways, etc)

{empty} +

=== Detail: Metrics

video::detailed_metrics_thumb.mp4[opts="autoplay,loop"]
Each detail view provides **predefined metrics dashboards**.  The metrics dashboards provided are tailored to the relevant application, workload or service level.

Application and workload detail views show *request* and *response* metrics (volume, duration, size, tcp traffic).  The traffic can also be viewed for either *inbound* or *outbound* traffic.

The service detail view shows request and response metrics per *inbound* traffic.

{empty} +

=== Detail: Services

video::services_traffic_routing_thumb.mp4[opts="autoplay,loop"]
The service detail view shows the user the workloads running the service. It also shows the *Istio* traffic routing configuration (VirtualServices and DestinationRules) associated with the service.

Kiali provides access to YAML definitions and allows modification and delete for authorized users. It provides wizards to assist in common configurations and performs additional validation on VirtualServices to detect misconfigured routes.

{empty} +

=== Detail: Workloads

image:workload_details_thumb.png[float=right, link="{imagesdir}workload_details.png"]
Kiali performs several validations on workload configuration:

* Are Istio sidecars deployed?

* Are proper *app* and *version* labels assigned?

Workload detail provides a view of the services for which the workload is handling requests, and the pods backing the workload.

Workload detail also allows access to the **pod logs**, and provides detailed traffic breakdown.

=== Detail: Runtimes Monitoring/Dashboards

image:runtimes_monitoring_thumb.png[float=right, link="{imagesdir}runtimes_monitoring.png"]
Kiali comes with default dashboards for several runtimes, including Go, Node.js, Spring Boot, Thorntail, and Vert.x.

These dashboards are simple Kubernetes resources, so you can use your favorite tool to create, modify or delete them.
As they are defined as plain _yaml_ or _json_ files, it's a perfect fit for keeping under source control like GIT, track changes, share, etc.

Check out the link:/documentation/runtimes-monitoring/[documentation page] to learn more about it.

== Configuration and Validation

=== Detail: Istio Configuration

video::istio_configuration_thumb.mp4[opts="autoplay,loop"]
The Istio configuration view provides advanced filtering and navigation for Istio configuration objects such as Virtual Services and Gateways.

Kiali provides inline config edition and powerful **semantic validation** for Istio resources.

{empty} +

=== Detail: Istio Wizards

image:istio_wizard.png[float=right]
Kiali provides powerful Wizards to hide complexity and make configuring Istio easy and safe.

Kiali provides a wizard for traffic routing. The user selects an action type: Weighted Routing, Matching Routing, or Suspend Traffic and then defines the desired parameters.  The Kiali wizard will create the specific Istio resources for the given Service.

Kiali is adding and improving wizards frequently!
