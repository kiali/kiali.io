== Introduction

The `openid` authentication strategy lets you integrate Kiali to an external
identity provider that implements link:https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID
Connect], and allows users to login to Kiali using their existing accounts of a
third-party system.

If your
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens[Kubernetes
cluster is also integrated with your OpenId provider], then Kiali's `openid`
strategy can offer role-based access control (RBAC) through the
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/[Kubernetes
authorization mechanisms]. See the link:{{< relref "../rbac" >}}[RBAC
documentation] for more details.

Currently, Kiali supports the _authorization code flow_ (preferred) and the
_implicit flow_ of the link:https://openid.net/connect/[OpenId Connect spec].

== Requirements

If you want to enable usage of the OpenId's _authorization code flow_, make
sure that the
link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali-operator/blob/7dafc469c95d4307ebd03c515a87c7f84eb64da7/deploy/kiali/kiali_cr.yaml#L746-L754[Kiali's
signing key] is 16, 24 or 32 byte long. If you setup a signing key of a
different size, Kiali will only be capable of using the _implicit flow_. If you
install Kiali via the operator and don't set a custom signing key, the operator
should create a 16 byte long signing key.

icon:bullhorn[size=1x]{nbsp} We recommend using the _authorization code flow_.

If you *_don't need_* RBAC support, the only requirement is to have a
working OpenId Server where Kiali can be configured as a client application.

If you *_do need_* RBAC support, you need either:

* A link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens[Kubernetes cluster configured with OpenID connect integration], which results in the API server accepting tokens issued by your identity provider; or
* A replacement or reverse proxy for the Kubernetes cluster API capable of handling the OIDC authentication.

The first option is preferred if you can manipulate your cluster API server
startup flags, which will result in your cluster to also be integrated with the
external OpenID provider.

The second option is provided for cases where you are using a managed
Kubernetes and your cloud provider does not support configuring OpenID
integration. Kiali assumes an implementation of a Kubernetes API server. For
example, a community user has reported to successfully configure Kiali's OpenID
strategy by using
link:https://github.com/jetstack/kube-oidc-proxy[`kube-oidc-proxy`] which is a
reverse proxy that handles the OpenID authentication and forwards the
authenticated requests to the Kubernetes API.

icon:bullhorn[size=1x]{nbsp} Several Azure users have reported that OpenId
authentication is not working correctly even after enabling Azure AD
integration in AKS clusters. As of now, if you need RBAC, you will need to
fallback to using
link:https://github.com/jetstack/kube-oidc-proxy[`kube-oidc-proxy`] or a
similar alternative. If you don't need RBAC, just configure Kiali accordingly.
As nobody in the Kiali team has access to Azure, contributions for improved
Azure support will be appreciated.

== [[setup-with-rbac]]Set-up with RBAC support

Assuming you already have a working Kubernetes cluster with OpenId integration
(or a working alternative like `kube-oidc-proxy`), you should already had
configured an _application_ or a _client_ in your OpenId server (some cloud
providers configure this app/client automatically for you). You must re-use
this existing _application/client_ by adding the root path of your Kiali
instance as an allowed/authorized callback URL. If the OpenID server provided
you a _client secret_ for the application/client, or if you had manually set a
_client secret_, issue the following command to create a Kubernetes secret
holding the OpenId client secret:

[source,yaml]
----
kubectl create secret generic kiali --from-literal="oidc-secret=$CLIENT_SECRET" -n $NAMESPACE
----

where `$NAMESPACE` is the namespace where you installed Kiali and
`$CLIENT_SECRET` is the secret you configured or provided by your OpenId
Server. If Kiali is already running, you may need to restart the Kiali pod so
that the secret is mounted in Kiali.

icon:bullhorn[size=1x]{nbsp} This secret is only needed if you want Kiali to
use the _authorization code flow_ (i.e. if your Kiali's signing key is neither
16, 24 or 32 byte long).

icon:bullhorn[size=1x]{nbsp} It's worth emphasizing that to configure OpenID
integration you must re-use the OpenID application/client that you created for
your Kubernetes cluster. If you create a new application/client for Kiali in
your OpenId server, Kiali will fail to properly authenticate users.

Then, to enable the OpenID Connect strategy, the minimal configuration you need to
set in the Kiali CR is like the following:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  auth:
    strategy: openid
    openid:
      client_id: "kiali-client"
      issuer_uri: "https://openid.issuer.com"
----

This assumes that your Kubernetes cluster is configured with OpenID Connect
integration. In this case, the `client-id` and `issuer_uri` attributes must
match the `--oidc-client-id` and `--oidc-issuer-url` flags
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#configuring-the-api-server[used
to start the cluster API server]. If these values don't match, users will fail
to login to Kiali.

If you are using a replacement or a reverse proxy for the Kubernetes API
server, the minimal configuration is like the following:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  auth:
    strategy: openid
    openid:
      api_proxy: "https://proxy.domain.com:port"
      api_proxy_ca_data: "..."
      client_id: "kiali-client"
      issuer_uri: "https://openid.issuer.com"
----

The value of `client-id` and `issuer_uri` must match the values of the
configuration of your reverse proxy or cluster API replacement. The `api_proxy`
attribute is the URI of the reverse proxy or cluster API replacement (only
HTTPS is allowed). The `api_proxy_ca_data` is the public certificate authority
file encoded in a base64 string, to trust the secure connection.

== Set-up with no RBAC support

Register Kiali as a client application in your OpenId Server. Use the root path
of your Kiali instance as the callback URL. If the OpenId Server provides you a
_client secret_, or if you manually set a _client secret_, issue the following
command to create a Kubernetes secret holding the OpenId client secret:

[source,yaml]
----
kubectl create secret generic kiali --from-literal="oidc-secret=$CLIENT_SECRET" -n $NAMESPACE
----

where `$NAMESPACE` is the namespace where you installed Kiali and
`$CLIENT_SECRET` is the secret you configured or provided by your OpenId
Server. If Kiali is already running, you may need to restart the Kiali pod so
that the secret is mounted in Kiali.

icon:bullhorn[size=1x]{nbsp} This secret is only needed if you want Kiali to
use the _authorization code flow_ (i.e. if your Kiali's signing key is neither
16, 24 or 32 byte long).

Then, to enable the OpenID Connect strategy, the minimal configuration you need
to set in the Kiali CR is like the following:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  auth:
    strategy: openid
    openid:
      client_id: "kiali-client"
      disable_rbac: true
      issuer_uri: "https://openid.issuer.com"
----

icon:bullhorn[size=1x]{nbsp} As RBAC is disabled, all users logging into Kiali
will share the same cluster-wide privileges.

== Additional configurations

=== Configuring the displayed user name

The Kiali front-end will, by default, retrieve the string of the `sub` claim of
the OpenID token and display it as the user name. You can customize which field
to display as the user name by setting the `username_claim` attribute of the
Kiali CR. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  auth:
    openid:
      username_claim: "email"
----

If you enabled RBAC, you will want the `username_claim` attribute to match the
`--oidc-username-claim` flag used to start the Kubernetes API server, or the
equivalent option if you are using a replacement or reverse proxy of the API
server. Else, any user-friendly claim will be OK as it is purely informational.

=== Configuring requested scopes

By default, Kiali will request access to the `openid`, `profile` and `email`
standard scopes. If you need a different set of scopes, you can set the
`scopes` attribute in the Kiali CR. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  auth:
    openid:
      scopes:
      - "openid"
      - "email"
      - "groups"
----

The `openid` scope is forced. If you don't add it to the list of scopes to
request, Kiali will still request it from the identity provider.

=== Configuring authentication timeout

When the user is redirected to the external authentication system, by default
Kiali will wait at most 5 minutes for the user to authenticate. After that time
has elapsed, Kiali will reject authentication. You can adjust this timeout by
setting the `authentication_timeout` with the number of seconds that Kiali
should wait at most. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  auth:
    openid:
      authentication_timeout: 60 # Wait only one minute.
----

=== Using an OpenID provider with a self-signed certificate

If your OpenID provider is using a self-signed certificate, you can disable
certificate validation by setting the `insecure_skip_verify_tls` to `true` in
the Kiali CR:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  auth:
    openid:
      insecure_skip_verify_tls: true
----

icon:bullhorn[size=1x]{nbsp} You should use self-signed certificates only for
testing purposes.

However, if your organization or internal network has an internal trusted
certificate authority (CA), and your OpenID server is using a certificate
issued by this CA, you can configure Kiali to trust certificates from this CA,
rather than disabling verification. For this, create a ConfigMap named
`kiali-cabundle` containing the root CA certificate (the public component)
under the `openid-server-ca.crt` key:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kiali-cabundle
  namespace: istio-system # This is Kiali's install namespace
data:
  openid-server-ca.crt: <the public component of your CA root certificate encoded in base64>
----

After restarting the Kiali pod, Kiali will trust this root certificate for all
HTTPS requests related to OpenID authentication.

=== Using a HTTP/HTTPS Proxy

In some network configurations, there is the need to use proxies to connect to
the outside world. OpenID requires outside world connections to get metadata and
do key validation, so you can configure it by setting the `http_proxy` and
`https_proxy` keys in the Kiali CR. They use the same format as the `HTTP_PROXY`
and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  auth:
    openid:
      http_proxy: http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@10.0.1.1:8080/
      https_proxy: https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@10.0.0.1:8080/
----

=== Passing additional options to the identity provider

When users click on the _Login_ button on Kiali, a redirection occurs to the
authentication page of the external identity provider. Kiali sends a fixed set
of parameters to the identity provider to enable authentication. If you need to
add an additional set of parameters to your identity provider, you can use the
`additional_request_params` setting of the Kiali CR, which accepts key-value
pairs. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  auth:
    openid:
      additional_request_params:
        prompt: login
----

The `prompt` parameter is a
link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest[standard
OpenID parameter]. When the `login` value is passed in this parameter, the
identity provider is instructed to ask for user credentials regardless if the
user already has an active session because of a previous login in some other
system.

If your OpenId provider supports other non-standard parameters, you can specify
the ones you need in this `additional_request_params` setting.

Take into account that you should *not* add the `client_id`, `response_type`,
`redirect_uri`, `scope`, `nonce` nor `state` parameters to this list. These are
already in use by Kiali and some already have a dedicated setting.

== Provider-specific instructions

=== Using with Keycloak

When using OpenId with Keycloak, you will need to enable the `Standard Flow Enabled`
option on the Client (in the Administration Console):

image::/images/documentation/authentication/keycloak-implicit-client.png[Client configuration screen on Keycloak]

The _Standard Flow_ described on the options is the same as the _authorization
code flow_ from the rest of the documentation.

If you get an error like `Client is not allowed to initiate browser login with
given response_type. Implicit flow is disabled for the client.`, it means that
your signing key for Kiali is not a standard size (16, 24 or 32 bytes long).

Enabling the `Implicit Flow Enabled` option of the client will make the problem
go away, but be aware that the implicit flow is less secure, and not
recommended.

=== Using with Google Cloud Platform / GKE OAuth2

If you are using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and its products such as
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), it should be straightforward to configure Kiali's OpenID
strategy to authenticate using your Google credentials.

First, you'll need to go to your GCP Project and to the Credentials screen which
is available at `(Menu Icon) > APIs & Services > Credentials`.

image::/images/documentation/authentication/gcp-credentials-screen.png[Credentials Screen on in GCP Project]

On the Credentials screen you can select to create a new OAuth client ID.

image::/images/documentation/authentication/gcp-select-oauth.png[Select OAuth on Credentials Screen]

icon:bullhorn[size=1x]{nbsp} If you've never setup the OAuth consent screen you will need to
do that before you can create an OAuth client ID. On screen you'll have multiple
warnings and prompts to walk you through this.

On the _Create OAuth client ID_ screen, set the _Application type_ to `Web Application`
and enter a name for your key.

image::/images/documentation/authentication/gcp-select-web-app.png[Select Web Application]

Then enter in the _Authorized Javascript origins_ and _Authorized redirect URIs_ for your project.
You can enter in `localhost` as appropriate during testing. You can also enter multiple URIs as appropriate.

image::/images/documentation/authentication/gcp-enter-urls.png[Enter URLs]

After clicking _Create_ you'll be shown your newly minted client id and secret. These are important
and needed for your Kiali CR yaml and Kiali secrets files.

image::/images/documentation/authentication/gcp-get-credentials.png[Get Credentials]

You'll need to update your Kiali CR file to include the following `auth` block.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  auth:
    strategy: "openid"
    openid:
      client_id: "<your client id from GCP>"
      disable_rbac: true
      issuer_uri: "https://accounts.google.com"
      scopes: ["openid", "email"]
      username_claim: "email"
----

icon:bullhorn[size=1x]{nbsp} Don't get creative here. The `issuer_uri` should be `https://accounts.google.com`.

Finally you will need to create a secret, if you don't have one already, that sets the `oidc-secret` for the openid flow.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: kiali
  namespace: istio-system
  labels:
    app: kiali
type: Opaque
data:
  oidc-secret: "<base64 encode your client secret from GCP and enter here>"
----

Once all these settings are complete just set your Kiali CR and the Kiali secret to your cluster. You may need to
refresh your Kiali Pod to _set_ the Secret if you add the Secret after the Kiali pod is created.

=== Using with Azure: AKS and AAD

icon:bullhorn[size=1x]{nbsp} The OpenID authentication strategy can be used
with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Azure Active Directory (AAD) with Kiali
versions 1.33 and later. Prior Kiali versions do not support RBAC on Azure.

AKS has support for a feature named _AKS-managed Azure Active Directory_, which
enables integration between AKS and AAD. This has the advantage that users can
use their AAD credentials to access AKS clusters and can also use Kubernetes
RBAC features to assign privileges to AAD users.

However, Azure is implementing this integration via the
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#webhook-token-authentication[Kubernetes
Webhook Token Authentication] rather than via the
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens[Kubernetes
OpenID Connect Tokens authentication] (see
link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-identity#azure-ad-integration[the
Azure AD integration section in AKS Concepts documentation]). Because of this
difference, authentication in AKS behaves slightly different from a standard
OpenID setup, but Kiali's OpenID authentication strategy can still be used with
full RBAC support by following the next steps.

First, enable the AAD integration on your AKS cluster. See the
link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/managed-aad[official AKS
documentation to learn how]. Once it is enabled, your AKS panel should show the
following:

image::/images/documentation/authentication/azure-managed-aad-enabled.png[AKS-managed AAD is enabled,700]

Create a web application for Kiali in your Azure AD panel:

* Go to _AAD > App Registration_, create an application with a redirect url like `\https://<your-kiali-url>`
* Go to _Certificates & secrets_ and create a client secret.
** After creating the client secret, take note of the provided secret. Create a
   Kubernetes secret in your cluster as mentioned in the <<setup-with-rbac,Set-up
   with RBAC support>> section. Please, note that the suggested name for the
   Kubernetes Secret is `kiali`. If you want to customize the secret name, you
   will have to specify your custom name in the Kiali CR. See the
   link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali-operator/blob/5e364ee48c08a1bdd200172b47f08b2ed0369c25/deploy/kiali/kiali_cr.yaml#L342-L347[comments
   for the `secret_name` configuration in the sample Kiali CR].
* Go to _API Permissions_ and press the _Add a permission_ button. In the new page that appears, switch to the
  _APIs my organization uses_ tab.
** Type the following ID in the search field:
  `6dae42f8-4368-4678-94ff-3960e28e3630` (this is a shared ID for all Azure
clusters). And select the resulting entry.
** Select the _Delegated permissions_ square.
** Select the `user.read` permission.
* Go to _Authentication_ and make sure that the _Access tokens_ checkbox is ticked.

image::/images/documentation/authentication/azure-access-token-ticked.png[Access tokens enabled]


Then, create or modify your Kiali CR and include the following settings:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  auth:
    strategy: "openid"
    openid:
      client_id: "<your Kiali application client id from Azure>"
      issuer_uri: "https://sts.windows.net/<your AAD tenant id>/"
      username_claim: preferred_username
      api_token: access_token
      additional_request_params:
        resource: "6dae42f8-4368-4678-94ff-3960e28e3630"
----

You can find your `client_id` and `tenant_id` in the Overview page of the Kiali
App registration that you just created. See this documentation for more
information:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/how-to-create-app-registration#collect-client-id-and-tenant-id
