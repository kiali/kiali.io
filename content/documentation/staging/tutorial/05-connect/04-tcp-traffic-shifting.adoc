The Travel Demo application has a database service used by several services deployed in the *travel-agency* namespace.

At some point in the lifecycle of the application the telemetry shows that the database service degrades and starts to increase the average response time.

This is a common situation. In this case, a database specialist suggests an update of the original indexes due to the data growth.

Our database specialist is suggesting two approaches and proposes to prepare two versions of the database service to test which may work better.

This step will show how the "Traffic Shifting" strategy can be applied to TCP services to test which new database indexing strategy works better.

NOTE: *Step 1:* Deploy *mysqldb-v2* and *mysqldb-v3* workloads

To deploy the new versions of the *mysqldb* service execute the commands:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiali/demos/master/travels/mysql-v2.yaml) -n travel-agency
kubectl apply -f <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiali/demos/master/travels/mysql-v3.yaml) -n travel-agency
----

NOTE: *Step 2:* Use the TCP Traffic Shifting Wizard on *mysqldb* service

</a>

Create a scenario with 80% of the traffic distributed to *mysqldb-v1* workload and 10% of the traffic distributed each to *mysqldb-v2* and *mysqldb-v3*.

</a>

NOTE: *Step 3:* Examine Traffic Shifting distribution from the *travels-agency* Graph

</a>

Note that TCP telemetry has different types of metrics, as "Traffic Distribution" is only available for HTTP/gRPC services, for this service we need to use "Traffic Rate" to evaluate the distribution of data (bytes-per-second) between *mysqldb* workloads.

NOTE: *Step 4:* Compare *mysqldb* workload and study new indexes proposed in *mysqldb-v2* and *mysqldb-v3*

TCP services have different telemetry but it's still grouped by versions, allowing the user to compare and study pattern differences for *mysqldb-v2* and *mysqldb-v3*.

</a>
++++

{nbsp} +
The charts show more peaks in *mysqldb-v2* compared to *mysqldb-v3* but overall a similar behavior, so it's probably safe to choose either strategy to shift all traffic.

NOTE: *Step 5:* Update or delete Istio Configuration

As part of this step you can update the TCP Traffic Shifting scenario to test a different distribution. When finished, you can delete the generated Istio config for the *mysqldb* service.
