The link:../tutorial/#02-graph[Observe, window="_blank"] step has spotted that the *hotels* service has additional traffic compared with other services deployed in the *travel-agency* namespace.

Also, this service becomes critical in the main business logic. It is responsible for querying all available destinations, presenting them to the user, and getting a quote for the selected destination.

This also means that the *hotels* service may be one of the weakest points of the Travels Demo application.

This step will show how to test the resilience of the Travels Demo application by injecting faults into the *hotels* service and then observing how the application reacts to this scenario.

NOTE: *Step 1:* Use the Fault Injection Wizard on *hotels* service to inject a delay

Select an HTTP Delay and specify the "Delay percentage" and "Fixed Delay" values. The default values will introduce a 5 seconds delay into 100% of received requests.

NOTE: *Step 2:* Understanding *source* and *destination* metrics

Telemetry is collected from proxies and it is labeled with information about the *source* and *destination* workloads.

In our example, let's say that *travels* service ("Service A" in the Istio diagram below) invokes the *hotels* service ("Service B" in the diagram). *Travels* is the "source" workload and *hotels* is the "destination" workload. The *travels* proxy will report telemetry from the source perspective and *hotels* proxy will report telemetry from the destination perspective. Let's look at the latency reporting from both perspectives.

The *travels* workload proxy has the Fault Injection configuration so it will perform the call to the *hotels* service and will apply the delay on the *travels* workload side (this is reported as *source* telemetry).

We can see in the *hotels* telemetry reported by the *source* (the *travels* proxy) that there is a visible gap showing 5 second delay in the request duration.

But as the Fault Injection delay is applied on the source proxy (*travels*), the destination proxy (*hotels*) is unaffected and its destination telemetry show no delay.

</a>

NOTE: *Step 3:* Study the impact of the *travels* service delay

The injected delay is propagated from the *travels* service to the downstream services deployed on *travel-portal* namespace, degrading the overall response time. But the downstream services are unaware, operate normally, and show a green status.

NOTE: *Step 4:* Update or delete Istio Configuration

As part of this step you can update the Fault Injection scenario to test different delays. When finished, you can delete the generated Istio config for the *hotels* service.
