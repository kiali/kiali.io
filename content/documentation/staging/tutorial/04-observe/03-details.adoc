Kiali provides link:../features/#_detail_views[Detail Views, window="_blank"] to navigate into applications, workloads and services.

These views provide information about the structure, health, metrics, logs, traces and Istio configuration for any application component.

In this tutorial we are going to learn how to use them to examine the main *travels* application of our example.

NOTE: *Step 1:* Navigate to the *travels* application

An *application* is an abstract group of workloads and services labeled with the same "application" name.

From Service Mesh perspective this concept is significant as telemetry and tracing signals are mainly grouped by "application" even if multiple workloads are involved.

At this point of the tutorial, the *travels* application is quite simple, just a *travels-v1* workload exposed through the *travels* service. Navigate to the
*travels-v1* workload detail by clicking the link in the *travels* application overview.

</a>
++++

NOTE: *Step 2:* Examine *Outbound Metrics* of *travels-v1* workload
++++

</a>

{nbsp} +
The Metrics tab provides a powerful visualization of telemetry collected by the Istio proxy sidecar. It presents a dashboard of charts, each of which can be
expanded for closer inspection. Expand the *Request volume* chart:

</a>
++++

{nbsp} +
Metrics Settings provides multiple predefined criteria out-of-the-box.  Additionally, enable the *spans* checkbox to correlate metrics and tracing spans
in a single chart.

We can see in the context of the Travels application, the *hotels* service request volume differs from that of the other *travel-agency* services.

By examining the Request Duration chart also shows that there is no suspicious delay, so probably this asymmetric volume is part of the application business' logic.

NOTE: *Step 3:* Review *Logs* of *travels-v1* workload

The Logs tab provides a unified view of application container logs with the Istio sidecar proxy logs. It also offers a *spans* checkbox, providing
a correlated view of both logs and tracing, helping identify spans of interest.

From the application container log we can spot that there are two main business methods: *GetDestinations* and *GetTravelQuote*.

In the Istio sidecar proxy log we see that *GetDestinations* invokes a `GET /hotels` request without parameters.

++++
<a class="image-popup-fit-height" href="/images/tutorial/04-03-travels-v1-logs-getdestinations.png" title="Travels-v1 Logs GetDestinations">
    <img src="/images/tutorial/04-03-travels-v1-logs-getdestinations.png" style="display:block;margin: 0 auto;" />
</a>
++++

{nbsp} +
However, *GetTravelQuote* invokes multiple requests to other services using a specific city as a parameter.

++++
<a class="image-popup-fit-height" href="/images/tutorial/04-03-travels-v1-logs-gettravelquote.png" title="Travels-v1 Logs GetTravelQuote">
    <img src="/images/tutorial/04-03-travels-v1-logs-gettravelquote.png" style="display:block;margin: 0 auto;" />
</a>
++++

{nbsp} +
Then, as discussed in the <<_travel_portal_and_travel_agency_flow,Travel Demo design>>, an initial query returns all available hotels before letting the user choose one and then get specific quotes for other destination services.

That scenario is shown in the increase of the *hotels* service utilization.

NOTE: *Step 4:* Review *Traces* of *workload-v1*

Now we have identified that the *hotels* service has more use than other *travel-agency* services.

The next step is to get more context to answer if some particular service is acting slower than expected.

The Traces tab allows comparison between traces and metrics histograms, letting the user determine if a particular spike is expected in the context of average values.

</a>

{nbsp} +
In the same context, individual *spans* can be compared in more detail, helping to identify a problematic step in the broader scenario.
