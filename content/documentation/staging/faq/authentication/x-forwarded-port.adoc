When using OpenID strategy for authentication and deploying Kiali behind a reverse proxy or a load balancer, Kiali needs to know the originating port of client requests. You may need to setup your proxy to inject a `X-Forwarded-Port` HTTP header when forwarding the request to Kiali.

For example, the VirtualService should have something like this to indicate the user should be forwarded to port 443 instead of 20001:

```
spec:
  gateways:
  - istio-ingressgateway.istio-system.svc.cluster.local
  hosts:
  - kiali.abccorp.net
  http:
  - headers:
      request:
        set:
          X-Forwarded-Port: "443"
    route:
    - destination:
        host: kiali
        port:
          number: 20001
```
