Sometimes the Kiali Graph Security Display option causes confusion. The option is disabled by default
for optimal performance, but enabling the option typically adds nominal time to the graph rendering.  When
enabled, Kiali will determine the percentage of mutual TLS (mTLS) traffic on each edge.  Kiali only
shows lock icons on edges with traffic that differs from the global setting for the time period.  If
global MTLS is configured Kiali will show a lock icon in the masthead and open lock icons on edges
with less than 100% mTLS traffic. Otherwise Kiali will not show the masthead lock icon and shows closed
lock icons for edges that have > 0% mTLS traffic.

Kiali determines the mTLS percentage for the edges via the `connection_security_policy` attribute in the
Prometheus telemetry. Note that this is destination telemetry (i.e. `reporter="destination"`).
