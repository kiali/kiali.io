This section describes some known issues in Kiali that may not be fixed in the very short term, and lead to limitations in a restricted number of cases. Hopefully, you won't even notice them.

If you are hitting a problem, whether it is listed here or not, do not hesitate to use the https://github.com/kiali/kiali/issues[GitHub issue tracker]. You can simply _vote_ (using emojis) for any existing bug or feature request, this will help us to understand the most demanded enhancements, or you can create a new ticket. For existing JIRA tickets, use the _vote_ link or add a comment describing your expectation or scenario.

The whole list of JIRA tickets can be found https://issues.jboss.org/projects/KIALI/issues/[here].

and JIRA for issues raised by the core engineering team. Both are publicly accessible.
