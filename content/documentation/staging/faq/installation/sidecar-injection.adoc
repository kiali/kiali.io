By default, Kiali will not have an link:https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/additional-setup/sidecar-injection/[Istio sidecar]. If you wish to deploy the Kiali pod with a sidecar, you simply have to define the `sidecar.istio.io/inject=true` label in the `spec.deployment.pod_labels` setting in the Kiali CR. For example:

```yaml
spec:
  deployment:
    pod_labels:
      sidecar.istio.io/inject: "true"
```
