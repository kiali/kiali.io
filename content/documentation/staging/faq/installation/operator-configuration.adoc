Once the Kiali Operator is installed, you can change some of its configuration at runtime in order to utilize certain features that the Kiali Operator provides. These features are configured via environment variables defined in the operator's deployment.

icon:bullhorn[size=1x]{nbsp} Only a user with admin permissions can configure these environment variables. You must make sure you know what you are doing before attempting to modify these environment variables. Doing things incorrectly may break the Kiali Operator.

Perform the following steps to configure these features in the Kiali Operator:

1) Determine the namespace where your operator is located and store that namespace name in `$OPERATOR_NAMESPACE`. If you installed the operator via helm, it may be `kiali-operator`. If you installed the operator via OLM, it may be `openshift-operators`. If you are not sure, you can perform a query to find it:
```
OPERATOR_NAMESPACE="$(kubectl get deployments --all-namespaces  | grep kiali-operator | cut -d ' ' -f 1)"
```

2) Determine the name of the environment variable you need to change in order to configure the feature you are interested in. Here is a list of currently supported environment variables you can set:

- `ALLOW_AD_HOC_KIALI_NAMESPACE`: must be `true` or `false`. If `true`, the operator will be allowed to install the Kiali Server in any namespace, regardless of which namespace the Kiali CR is created. If `false`, the operator will only install the Kiali Server in the same namespace where the Kiali CR is created - any attempt to do otherwise will cause the operator to abort the Kiali Server installation.
- `ALLOW_AD_HOC_KIALI_IMAGE`: must be `true` or `false`. If `true`, the operator will be allowed to install the Kiali Server with a custom container image as defined in the Kiali CR's `spec.deployment.image_name` and/or `spec.deployment.image_version`. If `false`, the operator will only install the Kiali Server with the default image. If a Kiali CR is created with `spec.deployment.image_name` or `spec.deployment.image_version` defined, the operator will abort the Kiali Server installation.
- `ANSIBLE_DEBUG_LOGS`: must be `true` or `false`. When `true`, turns on debug logging within the Operator SDK. For details, see the link:https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/ansible/development-tips/#viewing-the-ansible-logs[docs here].
- `ANSIBLE_VERBOSITY_KIALI_KIALI_IO`: Controls how verbose the operator logs are - the higher the value the more output is logged. For details, see the link:https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/ansible/reference/advanced_options/#ansible-verbosity[docs here].
- `ANSIBLE_CONFIG`: must be `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg` or `/opt/ansible/ansible-profiler.cfg`. If set to `/opt/ansible/ansible-profiler.cfg` a profiler report will be dumped in the operator logs after each reconciliation run.

3) Store the name of the environment variable you want to change in `$ENV_NAME`:
```
ENV_NAME="ANSIBLE_CONFIG"
```

4) Store the new value of the environment variable in `$ENV_VALUE`:
```
ENV_VALUE="/opt/ansible/ansible-profiler.cfg"
```

5) The final step depends on how you installed the Kiali Operator:

- If you installed the operator via helm, simply set the environment variable on the operator deployment directly:
```
kubectl -n ${OPERATOR_NAMESPACE} set env deploy/kiali-operator "${ENV_NAME}=${ENV_VALUE}"
```

- If you installed the operator via OLM, you must set this environment variable within the operator's CSV and let OLM propagate the new environment variable value down to the operator deployment (this command assumes you are on OpenShift and as such uses `oc` - if you are on Kubernetes, substitute all the `oc` references to `kubectl`):
```
oc -n ${OPERATOR_NAMESPACE} patch $(oc -n ${OPERATOR_NAMESPACE} get csv -o name | grep kiali) --type=json -p "[{'op':'replace','path':"/spec/install/spec/deployments/0/spec/template/spec/containers/0/env/$(oc -n ${OPERATOR_NAMESPACE} get $(oc -n ${OPERATOR_NAMESPACE} get csv -o name | grep kiali) -o jsonpath='{.spec.install.spec.deployments[0].spec.template.spec.containers[0].env[*].name}' | tr ' ' '\n' | cat --number | grep ${ENV_NAME} | cut -f 1 | xargs echo -n | cat - <(echo "-1") | bc)/value",'value':"\"${ENV_VALUE}\""}]"
```
