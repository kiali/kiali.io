icon:bullhorn[size=2x]{nbsp} Kiali currently requires Istio version *1.0*.

== Getting started on OpenShift

To deploy Kiali to your OpenShift cluster you can do the following.

=== Preparation

First, you need to grant the user that is installing Istio and Kiali the `cluster-admin` role.

If OpenShift is installed locally on the machine you are using, the following command should log you in as a user with the `cluster-admin` role:

[source,bash]
----
oc login -u system:admin
----

You can now install Istio if needed. See the link:https://istio.io/docs/setup/[Istio Setup docs] for details.

=== Install Kiali

Now install the latest release of Kiali.

icon:lightbulb[size=1x]{nbsp} The install script can be configured for a customized install by setting environment variables when running the script. For example, to install a different version of Kiali, set IMAGE_VERSION to the version you want. Also, if your Jaeger or Grafana are accessible at different URLs than the default, then set JAEGER_URL and GRAFANA_URL appropriately. The defaults are: `JAEGER_URL="http://jaeger-query-istio-system.127.0.0.1.nip.io"` and `GRAFANA_URL="http://grafana-istio-system.127.0.0.1.nip.io"`

icon:bullhorn[size=1x]{nbsp} This script requires `envsubst` installed and in your PATH; you can get it via the GNU `gettext` package.

[source,bash]
----
curl -L http://git.io/getLatestKiali | bash
----

By default, the installation script will prompt you to enter a username and passphrase for the credentials that you want users to enter in order to log in successfully to Kiali. The installation script can be customized through environment variables - see link:http://git.io/getLatestKiali[the comments at the top of the install script].

Once the above has completed and the Docker image has been pulled from Dockerhub, go to the OpenShift console, select the istio-system project and determine the base-URL of Kiali

[#img-openshift]
.OpenShift console
image::os-console.png[OpenShift console]
{nbsp} +

In this case it is `http://kiali-istio-system.192.168.64.13.nip.io`. In your case this could be a different IP.

You can also use the `oc` command to determine the base-url:

[source,bash]
----
oc get route -n istio-system -l app=kiali
----

== Getting started on Kubernetes

To deploy Kiali to your Kubernetes cluster you can do the following.

=== Preparation

Preparation is only needed if you are installing in Minikube. When installing in Minikube, ensure that you enable the Ingress add-on by executing the following command:

[source,bash]
----
minikube addons enable ingress
----

You can now install Istio if needed. See the link:https://istio.io/docs/setup/[Istio Setup docs] for details.

=== Install Kiali

Now install the latest release of Kiali.

icon:lightbulb[size=1x]{nbsp} The install script can be configured for a customized install by setting environment variables when running the script. For example, to install a different version of Kiali, set IMAGE_VERSION to the version you want. Also, if your Jaeger or Grafana are accessible at different URLs than the default, then set JAEGER_URL and GRAFANA_URL appropriately. The defaults are: `JAEGER_URL="http://jaeger-query-istio-system.127.0.0.1.nip.io"` and `GRAFANA_URL="http://grafana-istio-system.127.0.0.1.nip.io"`

icon:bullhorn[size=1x]{nbsp} This script requires `envsubst` installed and in your PATH; you can get it via the GNU `gettext` package.

[source,bash]
----
curl -L http://git.io/getLatestKialiKubernetes | bash
----

By default, the installation script will prompt you to enter a username and passphrase for the credentials that you want users to enter in order to log in successfully to Kiali. The installation script can be customized through environment variables - see link:http://git.io/getLatestKialiKubernetes[the comments at the top of the install script].

Once this is done, Kiali will be deployed and running in Kubernetes with an Ingress set up.

If you deployed in minikube, you can go directly to the Kiali UI at the URL `https://[minikube-ip]/kiali/console` where `[minikube-ip]` is what is reported when you run the command: `minikube ip`.

== Uninstall

To uninstall Kiali is simple - just delete the objects that have the label `app=kiali` from your cluster.

To uninstall from OpenShift:

[source,bash]
----
oc delete all,secrets,sa,configmaps,deployments,ingresses,clusterroles,clusterrolebindings,virtualservices,destinationrules,customresourcedefinitions,templates --selector=app=kiali -n istio-system
----

To uninstall from Kubernetes:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl delete all,secrets,sa,configmaps,deployments,ingresses,clusterroles,clusterrolebindings,virtualservices,destinationrules,customresourcedefinitions --selector=app=kiali -n istio-system
----

== Quick Start

If you do not already have an Istio-enabled cluster but want to see what Kiali is all about, you can try to run the convenience hack script link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali/tree/master/hack[cluster-openshift.sh] which will install OpenShift, Istio, and Kiali all at once:

[source,bash]
----
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiali/kiali/master/hack/cluster-openshift.sh
sh cluster-openshift.sh --kiali-enabled true up
----

This command installs an OpenShift cluster with Maistra and Kiali.

icon:lightbulb[size=1x]{nbsp} If you do not already have an Istio-enabled application to test with, you can install one using the link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali/blob/master/hack/istio[Bookinfo Sample install script] provided as a convenience. See link:https://istio.io/docs/guides/bookinfo/[the Istio docs] for more details about this sample application.

== The Kiali UI

Log in to Kiali-UI as `admin`/`admin`.

To achieve the best results you should have an example application like 'bookinfo' from the Istio examples deployed.

== Additional Notes

=== Customize the UI web context root

By default, Kiali UI is deployed to the top level of `https://kiali-istio-system.<your_cluster_domain_or_ip>/`.  In some situation such as when you want to serve Kiali UI along with other apps under the same host name, e.g., `example.com/kiali`, `example.com/app1`, you can edit Kiali Config Map and provide a different value for `web_root`.  Note: the path must begin with a `/`.

An example of custom web root:

[source,yaml]
----
server:
  web_root: /kiali
  ...
----
{nbsp} +

=== Reducing Permissions in OpenShift

By default, Kiali will run with the cluster wide `kiali` role.

If you prefer not to run Kiali with cluster wide permissions, it is possible to reduce these permissions to individual namespaces.

icon:lightbulb[size=1x]{nbsp} This only works for OpenShift since it can return a list of namespaces that a user has access to. Know how to make this work with Kubernetes? Awesome, please let us know in this https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-1675[issue].

The first thing you will need to do is to remove the cluster-wide permissions that are granted to Kiali by default:

[source,bash]
----
oc delete clusterrolebindings kiali
----

Then you will need to grant the `kiali` role in the namespace of your choosing:

[source,bash]
----
oc adm policy add-role-to-user kiali system:serviceaccount:istio-system:kiali -n ${NAMESPACE}
----
